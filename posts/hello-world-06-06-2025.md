*As developers*, we know that clear communication with our [tools](https://www.google.fr) directly impacts productivity. When working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, the verbs you choose can make the difference between getting exactly what you need and spending time refining outputs. Here&#8217;s a practical guide to action verbs that consistently yield better results.

## Core Principles

The most effective LLM interactions follow a simple pattern: **precise verb + clear context = optimal output**. Think of these verbs as function calls—each has a specific purpose and expected return type.

## Essential Verb Categories

### 1. Analysis &#038; Understanding

When you need the LLM to break down complex information:

* **Analyze, evaluate, assess**: Deep examination with different levels of judgment

* **Compare, contrast**: Identify similarities and differences

* **Diagnose, investigate**: Find root causes and explore issues

* **Identify, distinguish, categorize, classify**: Organize and label information

*Example*: &#8220;Analyze this error stack trace and diagnose the likely cause&#8221;

### 2. Creation &#038; Generation

For building new content or code:

1. **Create, generate, write**: Produce from scratch

2. **Design, develop, construct**: Build with architecture in mind

3. **Compose, draft, formulate**: Assemble coherent pieces

4. **Synthesize, compile**: Combine multiple sources or concepts

*Example*: &#8220;Design a REST API schema for a user authentication system&#8221;

### 3. Explanation &#038; Teaching

For knowledge transfer and clarity:

&#8211; **Explain, describe, clarify**: Provide understanding at different depths

&#8211; **Demonstrate, illustrate**: Show with examples

&#8211; **Walk through, break down**: Step-by-step guidance

&#8211; **Summarize, outline**: Condense key points

*Example*: &#8220;Walk through this algorithm&#8217;s time complexity analysis&#8221;

### 4. Problem-Solving

For debugging and optimization:

&#8211; **Solve, troubleshoot, debug, fix**: Address issues directly

&#8211; **Optimize, improve, enhance**: Make better

&#8211; **Refine, streamline**: Polish and simplify

&#8211; **Transform, convert, adapt, modify**: Change form or function

*Example*: &#8220;Debug why this React component renders twice&#8221;

### 5. Information Processing

For working with existing content:

&#8211; **Extract, compile, organize**: Gather and arrange

&#8211; **Structure, format**: Apply systematic organization

&#8211; **Condense, expand**: Adjust detail level

&#8211; **Translate, paraphrase, rewrite**: Change expression

&#8211; **Proofread, edit, revise, fact-check**: Ensure quality

*Example*: &#8220;Extract all API endpoints from this documentation and organize by resource type&#8221;

### 6. Reasoning &#038; Logic

For analytical thinking:

&#8211; **Reason, deduce, infer**: Draw logical conclusions

&#8211; **Predict, estimate**: Make informed projections

&#8211; **Calculate, compute, determine**: Perform precise operations

&#8211; **Validate, verify, prove**: Confirm correctness

&#8211; **Justify, argue**: Build logical cases

*Example*: &#8220;Validate this algorithm&#8217;s correctness and prove its time complexity&#8221;

### 7. Creative Tasks

For innovative solutions:

&#8211; **Brainstorm, imagine, innovate**: Generate novel ideas

&#8211; **Conceive, invent, reimagine**: Create original concepts

&#8211; **Roleplay, simulate, model**: Create representations

&#8211; **Visualize, sketch, storyboard**: Create visual concepts

*Example*: &#8220;Brainstorm innovative ways to implement real-time collaboration features&#8221;

### 8. Research &#038; Discovery

For finding information:

&#8211; **Research, investigate, explore**: Deep investigation

&#8211; **Search, find, discover, uncover**: Locate specific information

&#8211; **Trace, track, locate**: Follow paths or connections

&#8211; **Gather, collect, curate**: Assemble resources

*Example*: &#8220;Research best practices for implementing WebSocket connections at scale&#8221;

## Pro Tips for Developers

1. **Stack your verbs** for complex tasks: &#8220;Analyze, then refactor this legacy code&#8221;

2. **Specify output format**: &#8220;Generate a TypeScript interface&#8221; vs just &#8220;Generate an interface&#8221;

3. **Include constraints**: &#8220;Optimize this query to run in under 100ms&#8221;

4. **Use domain-specific verbs**: &#8220;Dockerize&#8221;, &#8220;serialize&#8221;, &#8220;mock&#8221;, &#8220;scaffold&#8221;

## Common Patterns That Work

&#8211; **Review + Suggest**: &#8220;Review this PR and suggest improvements&#8221;

&#8211; **Explain + Demonstrate**: &#8220;Explain CORS and demonstrate with code examples&#8221;

&#8211; **Analyze + Optimize**: &#8220;Analyze this component&#8217;s performance and optimize render cycles&#8221;

## Verbs to Avoid

&#8211; Vague: &#8220;Look at&#8221;, &#8220;Check out&#8221;, &#8220;Deal with&#8221;

&#8211; Ambiguous: &#8220;Handle&#8221;, &#8220;Process&#8221;, &#8220;Work on&#8221;

&#8211; Passive: &#8220;Could you&#8221;, &#8220;Would you mind&#8221;

> Remember: LLMs respond best to direct, actionable language. Treat your prompts like well-defined function signatures—clear inputs lead to predictable outputs. The right verb sets the stage for the exact type of assistance you need.
